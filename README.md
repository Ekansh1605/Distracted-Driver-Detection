# Project---Distracted-Driver-Detection
Problem statement: Given the dataset consisting of driver images in car and corresponding labels for 10 nos. categories (e.g. safe driving, texting, talking etc.), My task is to build a classification model to predict the category for that image. Dataset link: After creating an account on Kaggle i got this :-(https://www.kaggle.com/c/state-farm-distracted-driver-detection).I downloaded the data and train the model using Keras.
